# Diagnostics

The diagnostics show you the syntax and semantic errors in the source code. Varieties of diagnostics such as errors and warnings will be shown. For a selected set of diagnostics, you can see the quick fixes. For example, the `variable assignment is required` diagnostic will have two associated quick fixes to create a new variable and ignore the return value.
