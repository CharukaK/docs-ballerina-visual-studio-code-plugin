# Diagnostics

The diagnostics show you the syntax and semantic errors in the source code. Varieties of diagnostics such as warnings and errors will be shown. They will show up in multiple places:

* In the Status Bar, there is a summary of all errors and warnings counts.
* You can click on the summary or view the PROBLEMS panel with a list of all current errors.
* If you open a file that has errors or warnings, they will be rendered inline with the text and in the overview ruler.
