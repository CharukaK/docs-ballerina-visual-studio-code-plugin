# Code navigation

## Go to definition 

This feature navigates you to the definition of a particular symbol. For example, when you invoke the `Go To Definition` option on a function call expression, it navigates you to the definition of the function. Apart from that, the peek definition will also be supported. The behavior will be the same not only for the constructs within the sources in the current project but also for external modules and standard libraries as well.

## Find all references

Invoking the references on a symbol will prompt you with all the symbol references in the current project.

## Rename symbols
This feature allows you to rename symbols by renaming all the references of the particular symbol.
