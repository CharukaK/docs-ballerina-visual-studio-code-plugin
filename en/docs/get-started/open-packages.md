# Opening Ballerina packages

You can work on a single [Ballerina Package](https://ballerina.io/learn/package-references/) at a time or use [Multi-Root workspaces](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WSO2.ballerina) of VS Code to work on serverl related Ballerina Packages at the same time. 

## Opening a Ballerina package

Use one of the following options to open a Ballerina package:

- From command line, execute `code <path-to-package-dir>`.
- From VS Code, click **File > Open Folder ...**.

## Opening multiple Ballerina packages

Once you have one Ballerina Package opened in the VS Code Editor, you can add other related packages to same workspace.

See the instructions on [adding folders to multi-root workspaces](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces#_adding-folders) in the VS Code Editor for more details.
