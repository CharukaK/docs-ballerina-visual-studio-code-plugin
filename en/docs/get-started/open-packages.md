# Open Ballerina packages

You can work on a single [Ballerina package](https://ballerina.io/learn/package-references/) at a time or use [Multi-Root workspaces](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WSO2.ballerina) of VS Code to work on serverl related Ballerina Packages at the same time. 

## Open a Ballerina package

Use one of the following options to open a Ballerina package:

- From the command line, execute `code <path-to-package-dir>`.
- From VS Code, click **File > Open Folder ...**.

## Open multiple Ballerina packages

Once you have one Ballerina Package opened in the VS Code editor, you can add other related packages to the same workspace.

For more details, see the instructions on [adding folders to multi-root workspaces](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces#_adding-folders) in the VS Code editor.
